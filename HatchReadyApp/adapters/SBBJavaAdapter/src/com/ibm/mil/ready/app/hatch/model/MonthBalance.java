/**
 * This class represents an object that will be used when figuring out the feasibility of a new Goal.  This is
 * in essence a tuple that consists of a month and a sum of all transactions that occurred within that month time frame.
 * The month is an integer, from 0 to infinity that represents the when the transaction took place. 0 means the
 *  total contained within the value field is the sum of all transaction that happened in the past month, or 
 *  to be more exact, that it happened within the last 30 days (here month always means 30 days, not actual 
 *  calendar days).  A 1 in the month field means the transactions occurred between 30 and 60 days, etc.
 *  
 *  As stated earlier, the "balance" field is the sum of all transactions that occurred within that 30 day period.
